/**
 * This is the fundamental abstraction: a single-abstract-method interface that has the following
 * properties:
 *
 *   - Doesn't enforce a specific memory layout. More specific interfaces can back `LogRecord` with
 *     mutables/immutables values, and avoid storing things that are not important.
 *   - LogRecord allows to precisely capture a lot of information. In particular, it does not
 *     enforce a `Map[String, String]` representation of context values that is not sufficient to
 *     leverage all the power from logging backends query engines, and without pulling a third-party
 *     JSON library.
 *   - The SAM-like nature of the construct makes it inherently middleware friendly, as a single
 *     method call needs to be intercepted/proxied in order to amend the behaviour of the logger.
 *
 * This also means that different libraries can use wrappers on top of this kernel interface to use
 * whatever UX is preferred without necessarily imposing constraints on the underlying
 * implementation.
